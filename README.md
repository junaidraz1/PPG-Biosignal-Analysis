# 💓 Analyzing a PPG Signal Step-by-Step

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of analyzing PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signals, aimed at understanding the fundamental steps involved in processing and interpreting heart rate and blood flow data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for developers and researchers interested in PPG analysis, from signal acquisition to feature extraction and visualization.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- **PPG Signal Processing**: Preprocessing techniques like noise removal and filtering.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features like heart rate, pulse rate, etc.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the PPG signal for better interpretation.
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: Using extracted features to train models for cardiovascular health prediction.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** 🐍
- **NumPy** 🔢 (For numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** 📊 (For visualization)
- **SciPy** 🔬 (For signal processing)
- **BioSPPy** 🧬 (For biosignal processing)
- **HeartPy** ❤️ (For heart rate extraction from PPG)
- **Pandas** 📊 (For data handling)

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **PPG Signal Acquisition**: Collect raw PPG data from devices like wearable sensors or databases.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the signal by removing noise using filters (e.g., Bandpass filter) and normalization techniques.
3. **Peak Detection**: Detect peaks (e.g., systolic and diastolic points) using algorithms like Pan-Tompkins or thresholding. The **HeartPy** library can be used to detect peaks and calculate heart rate.
4. **Heart Rate Calculation**: Measure heart rate by analyzing the intervals between peaks. **HeartPy** can be used to compute HRV (Heart Rate Variability) from the PPG signal.
5. **Visualization**: Plot the PPG signal to visualize heartbeats and other characteristics using **Matplotlib**.
6. **Feature Extraction**: Extract useful features (e.g., pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, HRV) for further analysis or classification.
7. **Optional - Machine Learning**: Use features for classification tasks such as predicting cardiovascular health or detecting arrhythmias.
